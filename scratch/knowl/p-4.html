<article class="paragraph"><h5 xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64" class="heading"><span class="type">Paragraph</span></h5>The idea of <a knowl="./knowl/t-conn-def-path.html" knowl-id="xref-t-conn-def-path" alt="Definition 2.1 " title="Definition 2.1 ">Definition 2.1</a> is that the points \(\gamma(0)\) and \(\gamma(1)\) are the two endpoints. Since the function \(\gamma\) is continuous, the images \(\gamma(t)\) for \(0 \lt t \lt 1\) link the two endpoints without picking up the pencil. Many reasonable people would object to <a knowl="./knowl/t-conn-def-path.html" knowl-id="xref-t-conn-def-path" alt="Definition 2.1 " title="Definition 2.1 ">Definition 2.1</a>. After all, it is the <!--Style me with CSS--><em xmlns:b64="https://github.com/ilyakharlamov/xslt_base64">image</em> of \(\gamma\) that we would typically call the path. However, the definition as given is ubiquitous in topology. When it is convenient we do abuse terminology and refer indirectly to the image of \(\gamma\) as a path joining \(\gamma(0)\) to \(\gamma(1)\).</article><span class="incontext"><a href="t-conn-introduction.html#p-4">in-context</a></span>
